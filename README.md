# 🚗 Car Sales Linear Regression Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use **Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn** to analyse car sales data and predict future sales using **Linear Regression**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `carsales.csv` → Original dataset (Jan–Jun car sales for Mercedes, Ford, Tesla)
- `ReadCSV.py` → Load and analyse data (filter, totals, averages)
- `PredictSales.py` → Train ML models and predict July sales for each brand
- `sales_predictions.csv` → Output file with predictions

## 🔑 Features
- Create and save dataset using Pandas
- Read data from CSV and perform analysis
- Calculate total and average sales per brand
- Apply **Linear Regression** to predict future sales
- Save predictions to a new CSV file

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn (LinearRegression)
